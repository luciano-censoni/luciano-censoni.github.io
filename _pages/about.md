Dr. Luciano Censoni is a postdoctoral fellow working in Per Petersson’s laboratory at Umeå University in Sweden since 2019. Trained as a physicist at the University of São Paulo, with a background in computational modeling of protein structures and a deep interest in networks, Luciano moved to Sweden after his Ph.D. at the University of Campinas to assume a position as a data analyst in Per Petersson’s group. For the past four years he has worked in close collaboration with experimentalists in order to simultaneously facilitate the acquisition of large, multi-modal neurophysiological datasets, and extract novel insights from them.
